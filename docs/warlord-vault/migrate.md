# Migrate

To facilitate migration from v1 vault (tWAR) to v2 (thWAR), a migration contract has been deployed and a section on the website has been added.

Note that this is a helper and is not mandatory to migrate.

What the migration contract does is withdrawing WARs from the v1 vault and instantly redeposit on the v2 vault. To perform those operations, the tWAR must be aproved to the migration contract.
